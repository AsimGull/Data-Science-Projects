## Implement CycleGAN for converting poor-quality images of Specular/ confocal microscopy into Good quality

Medical images with blurring effects or uneven intensity provide difficulties for automated screening, assessment, and diagnosis. The pictures of corneal endothelium taken by specular microscopy and confocal microscopy do not provide promises results always, such as Images come with blur effects or missing important details. Previously, simple Generative adversarial network was being used to enhance the images, with the requirement of paired images. In order to deal with this problem, I have used CycleGAN algorithm for enhancing the poor-quality images of corneal endothelium into good quality without paired images dataset. CycleGAN deals poor and good quality images as two different classes. It takes poor quality image as an input, generate good quality image, and reconstruct the original image. Moreover, It uses the adversarial loss for each GAN to improve the learning performance of generator as well as discriminator and calculate the Cycle consistency loss between original given input and generated output image. This experiment is conducted on mixture of corneal endothelium medical images captured by noncontact specular and confocal microscopy. The model showed promising results which might help eyes practitioners to understand corneal endothelium layer in detail.
