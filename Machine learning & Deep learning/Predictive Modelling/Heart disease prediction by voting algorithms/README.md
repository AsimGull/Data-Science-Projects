# Heart-Disease-prediction-by-Voting-machine-learning
## Dataset files Description: 
1. X_Train.csv: It contains all Training Dataset on which you are going to build your ML Model 
2. X_text.csv: It contains total Test Dataset on which you are going to test your ML Model 
3. Y_train.csv: It contains all Training Dataset label.
#### some outcomes of the project
1. Data Preprocessing and  situations that are problematic for our algorithms, such as the “curse of dimensionality” or the difficulty of learning from unbalanced training data and missing values problem. You might want to explore techniques for handling these problems in the given dataset.
2. Applying more than 5 Machine Learning algorithms for the prediction and apply majority voting concept for the final output. Majority voting means to take Predicted labels from all applied classifiers and assign final label according to majority vote.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Accuracy, F Score.
