# Project Overview

This project focuses on the classification of DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks using machine learning techniques. DDoS attacks are a prevalent form of cyber threat wherein attackers overwhelm a target system with a flood of incoming traffic, rendering it inaccessible to legitimate users.

## Dataset

The dataset utilized in this project consists of a collection of binaries, including legitimate files and malware samples. Through exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, and model building, the aim is to develop robust classifiers capable of distinguishing between legitimate files and those associated with malware, which could potentially be used in DDoS attacks.

## Key Chapters

### 1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
This chapter delves into the initial steps of understanding the dataset, including its structure, features, and basic statistics. Data cleaning processes are implemented to prepare the dataset for model training.

### 2. Model Building - Random Forest
The Random Forest classifier is employed in this chapter to build a model for classifying legitimate files and malware samples. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrices are utilized to assess the performance of the model.

### 3. Model Building - Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression, another popular classification algorithm, is implemented in this chapter. Despite encountering convergence warnings, the model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrices.

### 4. Model Building - Neural Network
A Neural Network model is constructed in this chapter, leveraging the TensorFlow library. The architecture of the neural network is defined, and the model is trained and evaluated using accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrices.

These chapters collectively showcase the process of developing and evaluating machine learning models for DDoS attack classification, offering insights into the effectiveness of various algorithms in addressing cybersecurity challenges.
