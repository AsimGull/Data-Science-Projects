### Introduction

Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are significant threats to the stability and reliability of online services. Detecting and mitigating these attacks is crucial to maintaining the integrity of networks and services. This project focuses on classifying DDoS attacks using various machine learning models. The dataset used for this project is the IDS 2017 dataset, which is publicly available and provides a comprehensive set of features for detecting DDoS attacks.

The project involves several key steps: data preprocessing, exploration, splitting, model training, evaluation, and comparison. Each step is crucial to building an effective DDoS detection model. We employ multiple machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks, to classify the attacks and evaluate their performance using various metrics.

### Chapters Overview

#### 1. Importing Libraries
This chapter covers the importation of essential libraries used for data manipulation, visualization, model training, and evaluation. Libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn are utilized.

#### 2. Data Pre-processing
This section involves preparing the data for analysis by cleaning and transforming it. Steps include handling missing values, converting categorical labels to numerical values, and ensuring data types are appropriate for analysis.

#### 3. Data Exploring
Data exploration involves generating descriptive statistics and visualizations to understand the distribution and relationships within the dataset. This step helps in identifying important features and potential issues with the data.

#### 4. Data Splitting
In this chapter, the data is split into training and testing sets. This step is crucial for evaluating the model's performance on unseen data, ensuring that the model generalizes well.

#### 5. Model Training
This section covers the training of different machine learning models:
   - **Random Forest**: An ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees to improve predictive accuracy.
   - **Logistic Regression**: A statistical model used for binary classification.
   - **Neural Network**: A computational model inspired by the human brain, capable of capturing complex patterns in the data.

#### 6. Model Evaluation
The trained models are evaluated using various metrics:
   - **Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly predicted instances.
   - **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, useful for imbalanced datasets.
   - **Recall**: The ability of the model to identify all relevant instances.
   - **Precision**: The accuracy of the positive predictions.
   - **Confusion Matrix**: A table that describes the performance of the classification model.

#### 7. Model Comparison
In this chapter, the performance of the different models is compared using ROC curves and AUC scores. This comparison helps in identifying the best-performing model for DDoS attack classification.

### Conclusion
The project systematically addresses the detection and classification of DDoS attacks using multiple machine learning models. By following the structured approach outlined in the chapters, we aim to build a robust model that can effectively distinguish between benign and malicious network traffic.
