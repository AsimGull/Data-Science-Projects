# Data Science Projects

## Overview
Welcome to my Data Science repository! This repository is a comprehensive collection of projects that showcase various techniques and applications in data science, including machine learning and deep learning. Each project is designed to address specific real-world problems using advanced analytical and predictive modeling techniques.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into two main categories: **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning**. Within each of these categories, you will find projects further divided into subcategories based on the application area, such as Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Time Series Analysis, and Predictive Modeling (e.g., regression).

### Main Categories

#### Machine Learning
- **Computer Vision**
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- **Time Series Analysis**
- **Predictive Modeling (Regression, Classification)**

#### Deep Learning
- **Computer Vision**
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- **Time Series Analysis**
- **Predictive Modeling (Regression, Classification)**

## How to Navigate
Each project directory contains:
- **README.md**: Detailed documentation about the project, including its objective, dataset description, methodology, and how to run the code.
- **Source Code**: The main codebase for the project.
- **Datasets**: Links or references to the datasets used in the projects.
- **Results**: Outputs and results from the model, including visualizations and performance metrics.
